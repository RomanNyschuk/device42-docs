**IP Address Management _\[aka IPAM\]_** software helps IT systems admins track and manage the IP addresses in their computer networks.

[IP Address Management (IPAM)](https://www.device42.com/features/ip-address-management/) is an essential part of Device42. With Device42's comprehensive network autodiscovery, it's never been easier to maintain up-to-date documentation of your IP Addresses, MAC Addresses, and DNS Infrastructure. In this section, we will cover VLAN, Subnet, IP Address, MAC Address, Switch Port Connectivity, and IP NATs.

## Discovering IP Addresses

There are multiple ways Device42 can discover IP Addresses and related information:

- [Network SNMP Discovery](auto-discovery/network-auto-discovery.mdx): Configuring and running SNMP autodiscovery to gather subnets, IP to MAC Address relationships, and MAC Address to Switch Port relationship information.
- [Device42's Auto Discovery](auto-discovery/windows-and-hyper-v-auto-discovery.md): Using the autodiscovery client to discover Microsoft Windows and Linux and/or UNIX devices on your network, including their IP and MAC Address details.
- [Device42's Ping Sweep Tool](auto-discovery/d42-ping-sweep.md): This page details usage of the ping sweep utility to keep your IP Address information up-to-date.

## Importing IP addresses into Device42

Importing existing IP addresses from [Microsoft Excel & CSV spreadsheets](getstarted/importing-data-from-existing-spreadsheets.mdx) is easy - Take advantage of this powerful feature to import existing IP Address data from MS Excel and/or .CSV _\[Comma Separated Value\]_ spreadsheets into Device42 IPAM.
