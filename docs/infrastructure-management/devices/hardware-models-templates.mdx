This section discusses management of hardware models for physical, blade, and other device types. A hardware model in Device42 refers to a template that hardware CIs are deployed from. Each Hardware Model template specifies the rack display size, depth, image, part slots and connectivity, and power calculations for a given device model.

### Hardware Model List Page

Locate the hardware model list page under **Infrastructure > Hardware Models**. You can filter and search through existing models from this page. Click the name of a hardware model to view and edit it's properties. Make changes to an existing hardware model using the **Edit** on the top right of its view page.

    dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/hardware-model-templates/hardware-models-list-page-dark.png'),
  }}
/>

### Hardware Model Properties

Open a new hardware model form by clicking **+ Add Device Hardware Model** at the top right of the list page. 

In the **Name** field, enter the model name. The manufacturer name will be appended automatically whenever this hardware model is displayed. For example, you can enter "PE2950" for a Dell PE2950 and if the manufacturer chosen is Dell, it will add Dell in front when displaying the model.

**Type** : Indicate whether the model is for a physical device (regular), blade device, or other device (for example, laptops, workstations). Depending on what you choose, you will see size or blade size populated in the form.

**Size** is the size of physical device or type regular in Us. You can enter "1/2" or "0.5".

**Blade size** : the various combinations for possible blade sizes.

**Depth** : If you want to add back to back devices in the rack, use half depth.

    dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/hardware-model-templates/add-hardware-model-dark.png'),
  }}
/>

### Defining Ports on Hardware Models

During creation of a hardware model, you can specify all of the direct ports, part slots, and blade slots for each hardware model.

**Direct Ports** specify ports that are part of the hardware chassis and are not removable.

**Add ports when creating device:** Select this option and the system will automatically create all defined direct ports when a device is created.

<ThemedImage
  alt="Define ports on Device hardware model"
  sources={{
    light: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/hardware-model-templates/hardware-model-ports-slots-light.png'),
    dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/hardware-model-templates/hardware-model-ports-slots-dark.png'),
  }}
/>

### Editing the Layout of an existing hardware device

Users may edit the layout of existing hardware devices visually. Do this by visiting the CI details page for any existing hardware device, and clicking the **Layout** button in the upper right hand corner:

<ThemedImage
  alt="Physical device Layout button"
  sources={{
    light: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/hardware-model-templates/physical-device-layout-button-light.png'),
    dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/hardware-model-templates/physical-device-layout-button-dark.png'),
  }}
/>

This brings you to the layout view. **Turn ON** edit mode to add Parts slots, parts, and/or direct ports to the hardware chassis. Do this by dragging and dropping the grey icons from the left column onto either the **Front** or the **Back** representation of the device.

:::info
If you attempt to edit the layout of a device that doesn't have its ports / part slots / blade slots defined at the Hardware Model level, they won't be on the device layout.
:::

If your editing screen doesn't have any defined parts, and looks similar to the image below, you must first edit the Hardware Model:

<ThemedImage
  alt="If your hardware layout is blank, edit the model first!"
  sources={{
    light: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/hardware-model-templates/blank-layout-model-for-device-light.png'),
    dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/hardware-model-templates/blank-layout-model-for-device-dark.png'),
  }}
/>

Proceed to edit the hardware model that the CI you are looking at is based on.

1. Do this by going back to the CI details page, and clicking the link to the hardware model page (highlighted):
    
    <ThemedImage
    alt="Link to hardware model"
    sources={{
        light: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/hardware-model-templates/hardware-model-link-light.png'),
        dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/hardware-model-templates/hardware-model-link-dark.png'),
    }}
    />    

2. Do this by clicking the "Model Layout" button, at which point, you can edit hardware model to add missing part slots, direct ports, and/or blade slots:

    <ThemedImage
    alt="Model layout edit button"
    sources={{
        light: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/hardware-model-templates/hardware-layout-button-light.png'),
        dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/hardware-model-templates/hardware-layout-button-dark.png'),
    }}
    />

3. And proceed to add the missing ports and slots to match the layout of the actual physical hardware (example, not accurate):

    <ThemedImage
    alt="Add parts and ports to hardware model"
    sources={{
        light: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/hardware-model-templates/edit-hardware-model-light.png'),
        dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/hardware-model-templates/edit-hardware-model-dark.png'),
    }}
    />

4. You are now able to go back to the original hardware device CI itself, and modify its layout as desired.

### Device type and hardware type relation

By default, when a device is discovered using auto-discovery, it is classified as type **unknown**, unless it is a virtual device. This is because the discovered device could be a physical device, a blade device or other type.

You can easily change the device type in bulk by changing the type of the associated hardware model.

_Example:_
1. You discovered 50 devices with hardware Dell PE1950 and all devices show as unknown
2. PE1950 hardware is also created by auto-discovery. You go and change the type to regular (rack mountable) and assign a size of 1U. 
3. All associated devices will automatically change to type physical. 
4. Any future device discovery with hardware PE1950 is automatically categorized as type physical.

You can do also this efficiently using bulk edit and hardware excel import features.

### Device Bulk Edit

You can change the Type property for multiple devices at the same time with the **Change Type for selected devices** bulk action. For example, you can change the **unknown** device Type value to **physical**. 

1. Go to the Device list page under **Resources > All Devices**. 
2. Select the devices you want to edit from the table. You can filter for devices with the **unknown** Type using the dropdown menu.
3. Choose the **Change Type for selected devices** from the action list dropdown menu and click the **hammer icon** to proceed.
4. Choose the new device Type for the selected devices and click **Change Type for devices** 
5. Click **OK** on the notification window to confirm.

  }}
/>

### Adding images for hardware

You can quickly import images for hardware models and add the images in the hardware edit page, bulk hardware edit page or hardware excel import. 

1. Go to **Tools > Templates & Bulk Operations > Image files**.
2. Click the **+ Add Image File** button on the right.
3. Browse to the image file.
4. Click **Save**. To upload more images click the **Save and add another** button.

Image files can be in PNG, JPG, and GIF formats.

    light: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/hardware-model-templates/add-image-file-light.png'),
    dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/hardware-model-templates/add-image-file-dark.png'),
  }}
  style={{ width: '85%' }}
/>

### Hardware Merge Function

Using auto-discovery, imports, or the APIs, you sometimes might end up with multiple hardware names describing the same hardware model, and could have devices assigned to each of these.

There is a function to merge hardware models with another hardware model. You have to just make sure size, depth, type and blade size(for blade type) match for these 2 models. It would ask you to choose which hardware to merge into and would re-assign device relationships to chosen hardware object and delete this object.

### Hardware Bulk Merge Function

Navigate to the Hardware Model list page under **Infrastructure > Hardware Models** and select the two more items you wish to merge. From the Action menu, choose "**Merge selected hardware models** and click the **hammer icon**.

<ThemedImage
  alt="Hardware Model merge action"
  sources={{
    light: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/hardware-model-templates/merge-hardware-models-action-light.png'),
    dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/hardware-model-templates/merge-hardware-models-action-dark.png'),
  }}
/>

Choose the model to become the master. The master is the hardware model that all of the other models will be merged into.

Optionally, you can choose to add the merged hardware model's names as an alias in the new master. This is strictly for reference. All existing devices will associated with the new master hardware model.

Click **Merge hardware models** to complete the merge.

<ThemedImage
  alt="Confirm Hardware Model merge"
  sources={{
    light: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/hardware-model-templates/confirm-hardware-models-merge-light.png'),
    dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/hardware-model-templates/confirm-hardware-models-merge-dark.png'),
  }}
/>

Note that if the U size is different, the hardware models will not be merged. You will see the differently-sized models you attempted to merge back in the list page table.

<ThemedImage
  alt="Hardware Models with different U sizes"
  sources={{
    light: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/hardware-model-templates/no-merging-different-sizes-light.png'),
    dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/hardware-model-templates/no-merging-different-sizes-dark.png'),
  }}
  style={{ width: '80%' }}
