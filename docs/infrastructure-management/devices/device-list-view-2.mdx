## Device List View

The device list view offers an at-a-glance view of all your devices:

<ThemedImage
  alt="Device list UI"
  sources={{
    light: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/device-list-view-light.png'),
    dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/device-list-view-dark.png'),
  }}
/>

#### **List view functions**

1. Search for devices via a text string
    
2. Clone or add a device
    
3. Filter the devices by a number of different criteria
    
4. Sort by any of the column headers
    

## List View Bulk Actions

From the list view, you can also select multiple devices and apply bulk actions against selected devices. The bulk action drop-down shows all available actions, while the hammer (gavel) button executes the selected bulk action:

<ThemedImage
  alt="Bulk device actions dropdown menu"
  sources={{
    light: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/device-list-action-menu-light.png'),
    dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/device-list-action-menu-dark.png'),
  }}
/>
