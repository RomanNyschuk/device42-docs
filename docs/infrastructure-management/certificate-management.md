This module enables you to manage your SSL certificates in Device42.

### Certificate Autodiscovery

Device42 also supports autodiscovery of certificates. Create a new certificate autodiscovery job by navigating to **Discovery > Certificates** and clicking on the **+ Add Certificate autodiscovery spec** button.

    dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/certificate-management/certificate-discovery-list-dark.png'),
  }}
/>
<br/><br/>

When creating a certificate autodiscovery job, enter an IP address or range of IP addresses and the ports to scan for Device42 to import if found. If a certificate is found on an IP address already associated with a device in Device42, the certificate will also be associated with that device automatically.

    dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/certificate-management/add-discovery-job-top-dark.png'),
  }}
/>
<br/><br/>

You can schedule the certificate autodiscovery job at a specific time on selected days by clicking on the **+ Add another Autodiscovery Schedule** button to add a schedule.

    dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/certificate-management/add-discovery-job-bottom-dark.png'),
  }}
/>

### Certificate List Page

The list page for certificates, under **Applications > Certificates**, will show you all certificates discovered in Device42 along with their validity details. 

Under the **Days To Expiry** column you can quickly see how many days until the certificate expires. Scroll to the right of the table to see the **Serial Number**, **Is Key Encipherment**, 
**Is Key CERT Sign**, **Subject Alternative Name**, **First Detected** date and time, and **Encryption method** columns.

You can export certificates by selecting them from the list and choosing the **Export selected items** option under the **Select an Action** dropdown menu. Next, click on the **hammer icon** to execute the action.

  }}
/>


### Viewing Certificates

Click on the name of a certificate from the list page, under **Applications > Certificates**, to view it.

<ThemedImage
  alt="View certificate"
  sources={{
    light: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/certificate-management/view-certificate-light.png'),
    dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/certificate-management/view-certificate-dark.png'),
  }}
/>
<br/><br/>

When viewing a certificate that has been imported, you can now associate and see FQDN, multiple devices, IPs, and different validity dates to your certificates. This allows you to have a wildcard certificate and easily see different FQDNs or subdomains associated with it.

<ThemedImage
  alt="Device certificate details"
  sources={{
    light: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/certificate-management/device-certificates-details-light.png'),
    dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/certificate-management/device-certificates-details-dark.png'),
  }}
/>

### Certificate Instances

In addition to seeing all certificates, you can now see certificate instances - allowing you to see device/IP address relationships for individual certificates. Locate certificate instances under **Applications > Certificate Instances**. Filter certificate instances based on device building, service level, and customer.

### Certificate Reports

Though you can have multiple valid-to dates associated with a single certificate, Device42 reports still know to alert you based on the oldest date stored for a given certificate.

This allows you to run reports to see which devices you still need their certificates updated, allowing you to see your update progressing â€” which can prove especially useful with very large deployments.
