## Linode Autodiscovery

### Linode Discovery Items

<table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Cloud Service/Object Name</strong></td><td><strong>Where to locate in D42</strong></td><td><strong>Accessed API</strong></td><td><strong>Information</strong>&nbsp;<strong>Generated</strong></td></tr><tr><td>VMs</td><td>Devices --&gt; All Devices</td><td>https://api.linode.com/v4/linode/instances https://api.linode.com/v4/linode/instances/[linodeId]/disks https://api.linode.com/v4/linode/instances/[linodeId]/ips https://api.linode.com//?api_action=api.spec</td><td>Name, type, RAM, OS, HDD serial number and size, IP, etc.</td></tr></tbody></table>`

![](/assets/images/Image_29_Cloud_Disc_Linode.png)

For access to Linode, you will need your API Key. To create a Linode API Key, go to your Linode console...

![Linode](/assets/images/2015-10-18-linode-2.png)

Select "My Profile" and navigate to "API Keys"

![Linode](/assets/images/2015-10-18-linode-1.png)

From here, you can create your API Key that Device42 needs to gain access.

Optionally, you can also:

- Choose the vendor. Vendors can be user-defined or may be populated by the EnrichAI feature as part of discovery.
- Choose a VRF Group. If you select a VRF Group, then all IPs found will be placed in subnets in that VRF Group. This is useful if you have duplicate IPs in your internal network.
- Check the “Remove unfound instances from Device42″ box. If you check this box, then each time this autodiscovery job is run, any devices that were previously created for this account but were not found by the autodiscovery job will be deleted. By checking this box, you can ensure that Device42 will remain in sync with Linode. If you leave it unchecked, then you may end up with Device42 Cloud Instances (cloud devices) that no longer exist in Linode.

Next, you should "Save and Continue". Then you can click 'Run' to run the job immediately. Or you can save it or save it and have it run on a regular schedule.
