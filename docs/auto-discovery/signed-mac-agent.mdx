To install the signed mac agent, do the following.

1. Download the notarized agent executable from [https://www.device42.com/autodiscovery/](https://www.device42.com/autodiscovery/) for Intel or Apple Silicon macOS machines. 

2. Download the encrypted config file from the agent screen on the main appliance, under **Discovery > Agent Based Scans**.

  sources={{
    light: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/mac-agent/mac-agent-light.png'),
    dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/mac-agent/mac-agent-dark.png'),
  }}
/>

This will be an encrypted URL, and a public key with some other data needed for discovery. It uses AES-256 bit encryption.

The agent can be run as: `(sudo) <executable name> --config-file=<path>/d42_agent_config`.

To run the above

- unzip the notarized binary
- store the config file somewhere on the file system
- run the binary calling the config file.

Enterprise customers should be able to do this via JAMF or other MDM solutions.

## Notes

- The `-config-file` switch only works for this executable, and won’t work for any agent executable downloaded from the MA.
- All other switches will work as is (that is, as they work for agents otherwise, such as overriding the host).
- This will not auto-update (because that would break the signing), and they will have to be updated manually, or via MDM solutions.

## Troubleshooting

If the file doesn’t run, you need to clear the quarantine attribute by running:

```
xattr -d com.apple.quarantine  <executable name> 
```
