As of v18.13, you can create, view, and schedule DHCP Discovery jobs. Navigate to **Discovery > DHCP** to add a DHCP discovery job.

To configure a DHCP Discovery job, give the job a name, select a **Remote Collector**, and enter the DHCP **Server** and **Credential** information. 

Optionally, you can specify the use of WinRM as the Discovery mechanism and configure the URL prefix and port. These DHCP Discovery jobs can be scheduled like other discovery jobs and can automatically create devices from the DHCP lease information.
