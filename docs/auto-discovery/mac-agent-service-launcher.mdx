Here are the steps to install and launch the Mac Agent service launcher.

1. Download the signed Mac Agent from the [Device42 autodiscovery page](https://www.device42.com/autodiscovery-staging/). 
2. Log into the Device42 Main Appliance and navigate to **Discovery > Agent Based Scans**.

    dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/mac-agent-sl/encrypted-config-file-dark.png'),
  }}
/>
3. Download the `.plist` file from the website
4. Modify the `.plist` file as required based on your setup and required options
5. You need the config file and executable for `/opt/device42/` 
6. You need the `.plist` file for `/Library/LaunchDaemons/`

Now run:

```
sudo launchctl load /Library/LaunchDaemons/<plist file name>
```

## Making changes to the `.plist` file

If you make changes to the `.plist` file, you'll need to unload and then load it again by running:

```
sudo launchctl unload /Library/LaunchDaemons/<plist file name>
sudo launchctl load /Library/LaunchDaemons/<plist file name>
```

To make sure that it is correctly loaded, run:

```
sudo launchctl list | grep device42
```

## Installing via MDM

If you need to deploy in bulk to many machines, you can use MDM. 

Package the Launch Agent using Composer and deploy it via the JSS, Casper Remote or ARD.

Make sure to include this as post flight script to set some permissions and load the agent. Right click on "Scripts", click on "Shell Script" and "post flight".

```
#!/bin/bash
chown root "/Library/LaunchDaemons/NAMEOF.plist"
chmod 644 "/Library/LaunchDaemons/NAMEOF.plist"
launchctl load "/Library/LaunchDaemons/NAMEOF.plist"
```

## Notes

* By default, logs are stored under `/var/log`, or as otherwise configured under the `.plist` file.A
* The `agent_local.log` file is under the working directory. By default this is `/opt/device42`.
